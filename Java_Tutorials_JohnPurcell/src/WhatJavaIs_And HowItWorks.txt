Java is developed byJames Gosling, it is High level Language, Works on WORA concept(write once run anywhere)
Java is OBJECT ORIENTED, PLATFORM INDEPENDENT(when compiled gives a byte code, which is platform independent and it it interpreted by JVM)
Java provides Multi-threading.
Java is designed for distributed environment.


To download java, one must install JDK(allows to create programs), JRE(runs the program)
Java uses JVM concept - java virtual machine (helps in making platform independent)
